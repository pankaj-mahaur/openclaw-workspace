# Session Summary — 2026-02-14 (Compact)

## Identity / Setup
- You introduced yourself as **PhanX**.
- You renamed me to **Paplu**.

## Product Direction Agreed
- Build an **education-first healthcare MVP** first (not diagnosis/prescription).
- Core concept: **Manual AI Report Detective / Ayurnod AI Health Translator**.
- Core flow: symptom input → guided manual lab entry → AI explanation → health memory.

## Docs Created / Updated
1. Created notes file from your first long report:
   - `notes/medical-detective-platform-report.md`
2. Then merged your second report (Ayurnod) into one unified document in same file.

## Git Commits Done (local workspace repo)
- `4ae1981` — Add Medical Detective MVP report notes
- `7ba04b1` — Merge Ayurnod and Medical Detective reports into unified execution plan

## Strategic Starting Point (for tomorrow)
Recommended first execution sequence:
1. Lock compliance/scope boundaries (educational only, disclaimer, emergency triggers)
2. Setup skeleton (Expo + routing + auth + Supabase)
3. Build one end-to-end happy path first
4. Add structured AI safety layer (schema, confidence, emergency hard rules)

## What I confirmed I can do
- Write project code directly in workspace (visible in VS Code)
- Run installs/commands and bootstrap services
- Setup Supabase integration (schema, policies, env, client wiring)
- Build initial MVP flow end-to-end

## Next Action Trigger
When you return, say: **"go start setup"**
and we begin with project bootstrap immediately.
