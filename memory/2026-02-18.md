# Daily Notes — 2026-02-18

## Session Summary

### Setup Done
- Telegram bot paired with PhanX (user ID: 1385214566)
- Restored workspace from GitHub: `pankaj-mahaur/openclaw-workspace`
- Switched workspace repo to SSH + main branch
- SSH key for workspace: `/root/.ssh/id_openclaw` (ed25519)
- Committed and pushed: SOUL.md, AGENTS.md, TOOLS.md, HEARTBEAT.md, IDENTITY.md, USER.md, .gitignore
- Deleted BOOTSTRAP.md (setup complete)

### AyurNod Project
- Found existing codebase at `/root/AyurNod/AyurNod`
- Has full backend (TypeScript/Node + FastAPI agents) + mobile (Expo/React Native)
- Backend: server.ts, engine/, agents/, routes/, imaging/, safety/, output/
- Mobile: screens (Home, Chat, Symptom, Lab, History, Onboarding, BodyType, Settings)
- Already has OpenRouter AI integration built
- Linked to GitHub (`pankaj-mahaur/AyurNod`) and render.com for deployment

### Pending
- AyurNod GitHub SSH push access NOT yet set up
- PhanX generated a key locally but GitHub showed "weak key" warning
- Need to add RSA 4096 key from VPS (`/root/.ssh/id_ayurnod_strong.pub`) to AyurNod deploy keys
- SSH config for github-ayurnod host needs updating to use `id_ayurnod_strong`
- Tomorrow: finish SSH setup, then start working on AyurNod codebase

### Keys on VPS
- `/root/.ssh/id_openclaw` → openclaw-workspace repo (working ✅)
- `/root/.ssh/id_ayurnod_strong` → AyurNod repo (pending GitHub deploy key ⏳)
